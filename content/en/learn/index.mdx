# Learn About a Better Web

### Internal Setup

1. **Crafted Reading** is made up of 2 separate pieces: a "personal" series of enquiries designed to teach you one of the principles we believe are important for your own navigation of this new and wild web; and a series of "web 3" enquiries which is more technical and goes to the heart of critical concepts that we often don't reflect upon enough, like "Trust", "Value" and "Freedom".
2. The **Crafted Reading** is not long and hopefully not boring.
   It should take you around 5 minutes to read each piece, so we only expect 10 minutes of reading in order to begin discussing each module. The ideas each piece presents are not "the truth" - they are intended to get you thinking so that you can come to your own unique conclusions about a wide range of critical topics. If you would prefer to listen to each piece instead - along with an extended discussion of it - just add "#listen" to the end of the url. For instance, /learn/module-5/listening-stories#listen will take you to the audio for that crafted reading. 
3. **Curated Material** is **not** a long list of links no-one has the time truly to reflect on.
4. We have picked 3-4 pieces for each week, in different formats (video, text, audio), and we have written detailed briefs for each piece. This is because we don't want to flood you with information; we want to teach you how to find the best information and then use it to transform your understanding and develop the skills required to work with decentralized systems and tools. We recommend that you familiarise yourself with each brief before the conversation starts.

As you'll see in our first module, conversations are critical to Kernel and the framework for learning which we're presenting here. Throughout the course of each module, we will also have a number of smaller conversations on a variety of themes. These conversations are hosted between you and other Kernel fellows, because we learn best from our own peers.
